## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**
   Create a `.env` file with your Neo4j credentials:
   ```
   NEO4J_URI=your_neo4j_uri
   NEO4J_USERNAME=your_username
   NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```

3. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run Home.py
   ```

## üìà Similarity Score Calculation

The recommendation system uses a sophisticated scoring mechanism based on multiple factors:

1. **Genre Similarity (Weight: 2.0)**
   - Counts shared genres between movies
   - Each matching genre adds 2 points

2. **Actor Overlap (Weight: 1.5)**
   - Counts actors appearing in both movies
   - Each matching actor adds 1.5 points

3. **Director Overlap (Weight: 1.5)**
   - Counts directors working on both movies
   - Each matching director adds 1.5 points

Total Score = (Genre Matches √ó 2.0) + (Actor Matches √ó 1.5) + (Director Matches √ó 1.5)
