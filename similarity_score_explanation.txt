Movie Recommendation System - Similarity Score Calculation
=======================================================

The similarity score is calculated using multiple factors, each with different weights to determine how similar two movies are. Here's a detailed breakdown of the calculation:

1. Genre Score (Weight: 2.0)
----------------------------
- Counts how many genres the movies share
- Each matching genre adds 2 points
- Example: If two movies share 3 genres, genre_score = 6

Cypher Query Part:
```cypher
genre_matches * 2 as genre_score
```

2. Actor Score (Weight: 1.5)
---------------------------
- Counts how many actors appear in both movies
- Each matching actor adds 1.5 points
- Example: If two movies share 2 actors, actor_score = 3

Cypher Query Part:
```cypher
actor_matches * 1.5 as actor_score
```

3. Director Score (Weight: 1.5)
------------------------------
- Counts how many directors worked on both movies
- Each matching director adds 1.5 points
- Example: If two movies share 1 director, director_score = 1.5

Cypher Query Part:
```cypher
director_matches * 1.5 as director_score
```

Total Score Calculation
----------------------
The final total score is calculated by adding all these components:

```cypher
WITH similar,
     genre_score + actor_score + director_score as total_score
```

Example Calculation:
-------------------
Movie A and Movie B share:
- 3 genres (3 * 2 = 6 points)
- 2 actors (2 * 1.5 = 3 points)
- 1 director (1 * 1.5 = 1.5 points)

Total Similarity Score = 6 + 3 + 1.5 = 10.5

Weight Selection Rationale
-------------------------
The weights were chosen to prioritize different aspects of movie similarity:

1. Genres (2.0)
   - Highest weight because genres define the movie's category
   - Most important factor in determining movie similarity
   - Helps match movies of the same type/style

2. Actors/Directors (1.5)
   - Second highest weight
   - Important for matching movies with similar creative teams
   - Helps identify movies with similar production styles

Results Ordering
---------------
The results are ordered by the total score in descending order:

```cypher
ORDER BY total_score DESC
LIMIT 10
```

This ensures that:
- The most similar movies (highest total score) appear first
- Users get the top 10 most relevant recommendations
- Recommendations are based on multiple factors, not just one aspect

Note: The weights can be adjusted based on user feedback or specific requirements. For example:
- Increasing genre weight would make genre matching more important
- Increasing actor/director weight would prioritize movies with the same creative team
